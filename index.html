          <strong>David Josué Jiménez Silva </strong>is a Spanish professional footballer who played for Manchester City. Silva played mainly as a central or an attacking midfielder but can also play as a winger or second striker. He is predominantly a left-footed player and his passing ability and possession-retaining qualities have earned him the nicknames "Merlin" and "El Mago" from his teammates and fans. He is considered by many to be one of the best midfielders in the world and in the history of the Premier League

    <h2>Thank You</h2>
    <p>
      A true legend who transformed the club and took it to another level. A solid spine for the four-time Premier League winners since his arrival, Silva indisputably possesses a gifted brain, with a high football IQ. This manifests into his personality, and then onto on-pitch performances. You'll always find joy on even the worst of his days; a quality you can only associate with naturals like him. Here’s to acquiring future players with qualities uplifting the game, rather than look to replace David Silva, for his intellect is irreplaceable.
